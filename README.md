#Kubernetes Notes

# Build docker image
mvn spring-boot:build-image

# Run the sample project
docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-k8-demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

# Test the service
curl localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Create Kubernets deployment file
kubectl create deployment demo --image=spring-k8-demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT --dry-run=client -o=yaml > deployment.yaml
echo --- >> deployment.yaml
kubectl create service clusterip demo --tcp=8080:8080 --dry-run=client -o=yaml >> deployment.yaml

# Deploy image to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Now you need to be able to connect to the application, which you have exposed as a Service in Kubernetes. One way to do that, which works great at development time, is to create an SSH tunnel:

#Expose Services
kubectl port-forward svc/demo 8080:8080

#Test the service in deployed Kubernetes
curl localhost:8080/actuator/health

# What is Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation

# Namespace
In Kubernetes, namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

# Pod
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

# Deployment 
A Kubernetes deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that provides declarative updates to applications. A deployment allows you to describe an applicationâ€™s life cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pods there should be, and the way in which they should be updated.

# Service
An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
With Kubernetes you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

# Config Maps
A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.

#Secrets
A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in a container image. Using a Secret means that you don't need to include confidential data in your application code.

#Volumes
On-disk files in a container are ephemeral, which presents some problems for non-trivial applications when running in containers. One problem is the loss of files when a container crashes. The kubelet restarts the container but with a clean state. A second problem occurs when sharing files between containers running together in a Pod.

# Kubernetes
# Create namespace
kubectl create namespace
# View running pods
kubectl get pods
# View container logs
kubectl logs -f [pod-name]  
e.g kubectl logs -f demo-96f6b7cc5-mk5rm
# Decribe pod
kubectl describe pod [pod-name]
# View deployments
kubectl get deployments
# Describe deployment
kubectl describe deployment [deployment-name]
# View services
kubectl get services
# Describe service
kubectl describe service [service-name]
# View secrets
kubectl get secrets
# Describe service
kubectl describe secret [secret-name]
# Get a shell to the running container
kubectl exec --stdin --tty [pod-name] -- /bin/bash
# Delete resources in the current namespace
kubectl delete all --all
